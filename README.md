# CNIT381-Chatbot
A Chatbot created for the CNIT 381 final project

This file is also used to help setup the bot, and run it off of your own computer. 

Prerequisites: 
Visual Studio Code: For editing the commands, as well as running the bot
Webex Account, Webex teams: For interacting with the bot, as well as creating new bots, if desired
A Web Hook: For the bot to be able to send and receive messages through Webex Teams
Bots Email & Teams Token

Step 1: Download all of the Bots files, and put them in a directory that can be accessed by Visual Studio Code.

Step 2: Open the 381Bot.py file in Visual Studio Code, and fill out the bot_email, teams_token, and bot_url fields, with your bots Email, Webex Teams access token, and Webhook address respectively. Then, in the useless_skills.py file, put the bots Teams access token in the teams_token field.
